    <br>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals from the Canidae family, distinguished by their loyalty, diverse breeds, and a long history of companionship with humans since the domestication of wolves. They are known for their keen senses of smell and hearing, various roles from working animals to family pets, and a unique ability to form a mutual emotional bond with people that benefits human well-being.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Origin Of Dogs</h3>
    <p>Dogs originated from an extinct population of gray wolves, with domestication beginning in the Old World around 27,000 to 40,000 years ago, occurring with hunter-gatherer groups before agriculture developed. Less aggressive wolves scavenged near human camps, leading to a mutualistic relationship and the gradual transformation of wolves into early dogs through generations of selection. The first definitively domesticated dog, the Bonnâ€“Oberkassel dog, was buried with humans over 14,000 years ago. </p>
